# named block of code
# organise / neaten or code / keep it DRY

# anytime you need to apply the same bit of code over and over again
# store it in a method instead

# Whatâ€™s the difference between concatenation and interpolation? Give an example.
# Concatenation is the operation of creating a new string by sticking to strings together. Example:
full_name = "Sebastien" + " " + "Saunier"

# Interpolation is the operation of creating a string by executing code inside the string. Example:
full_name = "#{'sebastien'.capitalize} #{'saunier'.capitalize}"
